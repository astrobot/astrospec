This package contains a ``Spectrum`` class with useful methods for everyday tasks for astronomical spectroscopy analysis. The goal of this package is to provide a useful infrastructure. To that end, most of the methods of the object are fairly general, e.g. arithmatic on spectra, and thus should be applicable to spectra taken with many different instruments in many different wavelength regions.
